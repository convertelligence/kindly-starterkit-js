# Kindly Starter Kit for Javascript

Build your first webhook integration or a custom app backend that can integrate with the Kindly&trade; bot building framework.

## Quick start :rocket:

The fastest way to get started is to just deploy it to Heroku and watch the magic happen.

## Getting started

Open your UNIX terminal and run the following commands

```
git clone https://github.com/convertelligence/kindly-starterkit-js.git
cd kindly-starterkit-js
npm install
npm start
```

:tada: If everything went smoothly, you should have a microserver running at
[http://localhost:9292](http://localhost:9292) that you can use for further testing.

See the sections further down for more in-depth guides about building webhooks or app integrations with the Kindly framework.
