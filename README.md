# Kindly Starter Kit for Javascript

Build your first webhook integration or a custom app backend that can integrate with the Kindly&trade; bot building framework.

## Quick start :rocket:

The fastest way to get started is to just deploy it to Heroku and watch the magic happen.

[![Deploy](https://www.herokucdn.com/deploy/button.svg)](https://heroku.com/deploy)

## Getting started with the server

Open your UNIX terminal and run the following commands

```
git clone https://github.com/convertelligence/kindly-starterkit-js.git
cd kindly-starterkit-js
cp .env.default .env
```

Before you continue, open up the `.env` file in your editor.
npm install
npm start
```

:tada: If everything went smoothly, you should have a microserver running at
[http://localhost:9292](http://localhost:9292) that you can use for further testing.
